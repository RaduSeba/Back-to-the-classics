	<h1>Back to the Classics</h1>
	<p>Welcome to Back to the Classics, the ultimate gaming experience that takes you on a nostalgic journey to the golden age of video games.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Game Description:</p>
	<p>Back to the Classics features a 7x7 game board where you must defend your territory against an invasion of classic video game characters. Your objective is to strategically eliminate these invaders and prevent them from taking over your entire territory.</p>
	<p>Tutorial:</p>
	<p>To play the game, follow the tutorial below:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the game board, which consists of 7 rows and 7 columns. Some squares are inaccessible, while others can be occupied by characters (invaders).</li>
		<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> At the beginning of the game, a group of randomly generated invaders will have already occupied part of the territory.</li>
		<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Your task is to eliminate the invaders by forming groups of 3 or more of the same character. The larger the group, the higher your score.</li>
		<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Each interaction that results in a group of invaders disappearing will increase your score. The number of points earned depends on the size of the group.</li>
		<li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Be aware that if you eliminate a colony of 5 or more leader-type characters at once, the invasion will end, and you will be declared the winner.</li>
		<li><strong>Step 6:</strong> The game consists of 10 turns. If you reach the 10th turn and there is still free space on the board, you will also be declared the winner.</li>
		<li><strong>Step 7:</strong> If all the squares on the board are occupied by invaders and there is no possibility of placing new invaders, the invaders will be declared the winners, and you will end the game with a score of 0.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Are you ready to defend your territory and relive the classic gaming era?</p>
